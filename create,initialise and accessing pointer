by using for loop
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a[]={10,20,30,40,50};
    int *ptr=a;
    int l=sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
    printf("address of variable a is %p\n",a);
    printf("address of pointer ptr is %p\n",ptr);
    printf("address of pointer ptr is %p\n",&ptr);
    for(int i=0;i<l;i++)

        printf("array address at index %d is %p\n", i,&ptr[i]);
    }
}

output:
address of variable a is 0x7ffe61da41b0
address of pointer ptr is 0x7ffe61da41b0
address of pointer ptr is 0x7ffe61da41a8
array element at index 0 is 10
array address at index 0 is 0x7ffe61da41b0
array element at index 1 is 20
array address at index 1 is 0x7ffe61da41b4
array element at index 2 is 30
array address at index 2 is 0x7ffe61da41b8
array element at index 3 is 40
array address at index 3 is 0x7ffe61da41bc
array element at index 4 is 50
array address at index 4 is 0x7ffe61da41c0
